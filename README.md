This project contains tests and experiments using the Tone.js and p5.js audio libraries to create audio tools for sound design and music production with web technologies.

- **Tone.js**: A framework for creating interactive music in the browser.
- **p5.js**: A JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. These test focus on the p5.sound library.
